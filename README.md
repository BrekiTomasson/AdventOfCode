# Advent of Code

## What is This?

Advent of Code is a yearly challenge to coders running from December 1st until Christmas. Every day features a new 
two-part challenge where the second part is hidden until the first part is solved. Most of the time, the second part 
is designed in such a way that it will be extra difficult - or impossible! - if you solved the first part in a way 
that does not follow good coding principles.

## Okay, So ...

I've played around with Advent of Code before, starting in 2016. Through the years, I've tried the various days 
using either PHP or NodeJS, and the results have been ... well; mixed at best. I skipped 2019 due to other coding 
projects that were taking all of my time and effort, and decided to get back to it now in 2020. Having developed by 
leaps and bounds as a coder since my last attempt in 2018, I decided to start fresh with a new repository and structure.

## That Sounds Great, But ...

This year, I'll be doing Advent of Code using PHP 8.0, using as few external packages as I can. The only third party 
package that I installed before even starting to write any code was `Illuminate/Collections`, as my many years of 
working with Laravel projects have made it so that I can't but help reach for Collections whenever I have a list of 
anything.

I'm also going to be trying my damndest to write this as cleanly as possible, using proper Object-Oriented 
Programming methods and principles, avoiding any and all shortcuts, and ensuring that everything is done properly 
with Single Responsibilities, tests and so on.

## Can I Copy Your Code?

That kind of defeats the purpose of Advent of Code, but sure. I'm just doing this for fun and to test my skills 
against these riddles and puzzles. If you find something in here worth keeping, then - by all means - copy what you 
want and use it in your own code.
